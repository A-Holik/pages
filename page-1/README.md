# About my code

I used HTML and CSS for basic. I added some Javascript for scroll to top button, sticky menu and menu bar. 
I also used [GSAP greensock library](https://greensock.com/) to make simple headers animation.

# Note

Im using free stuff and writing code for educational purpose.
Every pictures what i'm using in my projects are from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) or my own.
Icons are from [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
