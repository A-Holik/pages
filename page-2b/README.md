This is a example of my page - same look as Page 2.

# About my code

I used HTML and CSS for basic. I added some Javascript for counters and menu bar.
You can use php basics to shorten your code. 
Why i used that? Write nav menu, footer or other functionality which repeats many times is Sisyphean work.
You can save your time using some basic knowledge. I think this is a good way when u have many subpages. If you want add one position in you nav menu or footer u can easily change it in one file.

# Note
