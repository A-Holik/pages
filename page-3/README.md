# Page 3

This is a example of my page. This is the same template as Page 2 but as you can see i added dark mode.

# About my code

I used HTML and CSS for basic. I added some Javascript for counters and menu bar. 
I used localstorage for darkmode.

# Problems

My code isn't complete. Flickering problem when switching subpages is annyoing.

# Note

Im using free stuff and writing code for educational purpose.
